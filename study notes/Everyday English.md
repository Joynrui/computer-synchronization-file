## Using similes to improve your everyday English

The different features between similes and metaphors:

SIMILES:    **S =  A is like B.**    or    **A is as…as B.**

METAPHORS: **M = A is B.**         comparing two things

1. She eats like a pig.
2. He drinks like a fish. // A man who drinks is surrounded by liquid
3. I've been working like a dog. // working hard
4. They are fighting like a cat and a dog.
5. You smoke like a chimney.
6. It's like watching paint dry. //  Waiting for a long time to do something or someone coming.
7. She's as timid as a mouse.  // Someone who is timid.
8. I'm as blind as a bat without my glasses. 



## Use metaphors to speak English more fluently

**Metaphors** are different about **similes**.    Metaphors are **implied**, but **similes** are expressions comparing two things usually using " like" or " as". There are all **idioms**.

1.  Thanks for helping me -  You are an Angel!  // This is a metaphor, right?
2. The people in that club are just a **bunch** of sheep!  // bunch means fence, group, or another. 
3. You're such a busy bee!  // Someone always working hard and always learning new skills, or other things.  This's a positive idiom.
4. London is a **melting pot** of people and cultures. // Melt means " become liquid ", Melting pot like a smelter. (Does not need high temperature, just ferment.)
5. I have some good ideas but my boss shot them down.  //  not literally true 
6. My head is so full of problems, it's spinning. // (to spin, spin with yarn "eg: Mother used to spin her own yarn.")
7. Her dress has a very loud pattern. 
8. People are **flocking** to the pop concert. // flock means "bunch, group, lump" 
9. They were good friends at first, but then things turned **sour**. // Sour means some foods can't be eaten and they turn sour. 
10. All the world's a stage. And all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances…  ——– Shakespeare
